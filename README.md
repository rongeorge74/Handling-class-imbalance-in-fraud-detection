# Handling Class Imbalance in Fraud Detection using Sampling Techniques

This project aims to address the class imbalance problem in fraud detection, where the minority class (fraudulent transactions) is significantly smaller than the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions). Class imbalance is a common issue in machine learning that can lead to biased predictions. In this project, we use various sampling techniques such as **Random Undersampling**, **Near Miss**, **SMOTE**, and **ADASYN** to balance the dataset and improve the performance of fraud detection algorithms.

## Introduction
Class imbalance refers to the unequal distribution of classes in a dataset, which can lead to the misclassification of minority classes in machine learning models. In fraud detection, the minority class (fraudulent transactions) is often overshadowed by the majority class (non-fraudulent transactions), leading to inaccurate predictions.

This project uses several resampling techniques to address this imbalance and applies machine learning algorithms to classify fraudulent transactions with better accuracy.

## Motivation
The challenges of dealing with imbalanced data in fraud detection, as seen in financial institutions, have encouraged us to work in this domain. Accurately identifying fraudulent transactions can prevent significant financial losses and improve trust in financial systems.

## Objectives
1. Overcome the constraints of existing systems that lead to inaccurate fraud detection results.
2. Provide accurate solutions using appropriate sampling and classification techniques.
3. Use machine learning algorithms to generate accurate models for fraud detection.

## Datasets
The dataset used for this project consists of credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. It contains 284,807 transactions, of which 492 are frauds (only 0.172%). The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/dalpozz/creditcardfraud) and is highly imbalanced.

## Sampling Techniques
We used the following sampling techniques to balance the dataset:
1. **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)**: Generates synthetic samples for the minority class by interpolating between existing samples.
2. **ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling)**: Focuses on generating synthetic data for harder-to-classify minority samples.
3. **Near Miss**: An undersampling technique that selects majority class samples that are closest to the minority class samples.

## Classification Algorithms
After balancing the dataset, we applied the following machine learning algorithms to classify the data:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A simple but effective classifier for binary classification tasks.
2. **Random Forest**: An ensemble method that creates multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy.

## Performance Evaluation
The performance of the models was evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC)**

## Results
We found that the **Random Forest** classifier, when combined with **SMOTE** or **ADASYN**, provided the best results, achieving accuracy scores of 99.94%. However, some challenges remain in identifying fraud cases with high precision.

### Comparative Results

| Sampling Method        | Classifier       | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | AUPRC |

| Near Miss              | Random Forest       | 24.87%   | 0.98      | 0.03   | 0.72  |
| Random Undersampling   | Logistic Regression | 97.61%   | 0.89      | 0.61   | 0.79  |
| Random Undersampling   | Random Forest       | 97.94%   | 0.99      | 0.89   | 0.89  |
| SMOTE                  | Logistic Regression | 98.86%   | 0.87      | 0.78   | 0.78  |
| SMOTE                  | Random Forest       | 99.94%   | 0.98      | 0.81   | 0.81  |
| ADASYN                 | Logistic Regression | 96.38%   | 0.89      | 0.79   | 0.79  |
| ADASYN                 | Random Forest       | 99.93%   | 0.98      | 0.79   | 0.79  |

## Applications
This approach can be applied in various domains such as:
- **Fraud Detection**: Identifying fraudulent transactions in financial systems.
- **Spam Filtering**: Detecting spam emails in an imbalanced dataset.
- **Disease Screening**: Identifying rare medical conditions from diagnosis data.
- **Network Intrusion Detection**: Detecting malicious activities in network traffic.
- **SaaS Subscription Churn**: Predicting customer churn in SaaS businesses.

## Future Scope
The project demonstrates that handling class imbalance can significantly improve fraud detection models. In the future, we aim to:
- Explore other machine learning algorithms and optimization techniques.
- Experiment with real-time fraud detection systems.
- Enhance the privacy and security of sensitive data.
