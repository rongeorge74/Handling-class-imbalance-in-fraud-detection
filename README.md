# Handling Class Imbalance in Fraud Detection using Sampling Techniques

## Project Overview

This project addresses the challenge of class imbalance in fraud detection, specifically focusing on credit card fraud. The goal is to improve the accuracy of fraud detection models by implementing various sampling techniques to balance the dataset.

## Key Features

- Implements multiple sampling techniques:
  - Random Under Sampling
  - Random Over Sampling
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)

- Utilizes machine learning algorithms for classification:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Random Forest
- Compares performance of different sampling and classification techniques

## Dataset

The project uses a credit card fraud detection dataset from Kaggle, consisting of 284,807 transactions, of which 492 (0.172%) are fraudulent.

## Methodology

1. Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis
2. Splitting data into training and testing sets
3. Applying sampling techniques to balance the dataset
4. Training classification models on the balanced dataset
5. Evaluating model performance using cross-validation and accuracy metrics

## Results

The project demonstrates improved classification accuracy after addressing the class imbalance problem. Logistic Regression showed the highest cross-validation score of 94.44%.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Future Work

- Implement and compare additional sampling techniques
- Explore ensemble methods for further performance improvement
- Investigate the impact of feature engineering on model performance
